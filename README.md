# Traffic_Light_Simulation_using_loop
This project simulates a traffic light system using Python. It cycles through Red, Green, and Yellow lights with time delays, demonstrating how loops and conditional statements can model real-world processes. The menu-driven program allows users to start or stop the simulation, making it interactive and practical for learning basic programming concepts.
